### Added

- Add the admin Users page, native RPC handlers and React view for paginated app users and owner-managed roles. Register `UsersPage` with `usersHandlers` beside Jobs and mount `UsersView` using its bound query and role action.
- Add Platform auth user listing and transactional role changes on the existing Better Auth PostgreSQL schema, with typed owner-only and last-owner failures, change invalidation and actor/timestamp logs.
- Mount Users in the starter and generated apps. Existing apps receive the wiring with `pnpm dlx @shivaedev/create-app@latest update` after these packages are released; review template conflicts and install dependencies. Newly bootstrapped administrators also hold the owner role.
