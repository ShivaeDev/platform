### Breaking

- Move key imports from `@shivaedev/contract/keys.ts` to `@shivaedev/changes/keys.ts`. Declare bucket fields with `collection(name, idSchema, fields)` and publish affected buckets alongside record keys.
- Replace collection policy maps, `mergeReadPolicies`, `ReadPolicy` and `ReadPolicyMemoWindow` with each query's `readPolicy(payload, viewer)`. Declare the same query's live scope with `reads(payload, viewer)`. Bound query atoms and subscriptions refuse missing policies with a declaration error; one-off query `run` calls remain available. Denied queries refuse the entire subscription. Server adapters replace `QueryReads` and `ChangesReads` with `QueryDefinition` and `ChangesQueries`. Custom middleware calls `authorizeReads(effect, request, viewer)` and declares `MissingReadPolicy` and `QueryReadDenied` errors.
- Custom subscription adapters call `querySubscription(requests, viewer)` and pass the authorized result to `makeLiveServer.subscribe(subscription, context)`. `resolveChanges` supplies this subscription. Changed hints can carry query positions so bindings can rerun session-scoped reads without deriving session scopes in the browser.
- Remove `appHost`'s `readPolicy` option and module policy registration. Session and permission middleware apply query policies using the current session viewer. Handle the new typed policy errors in native clients.
- Replace `sessionCommandChanges` with `commandChanges` for custom session middleware. Command invalidation callbacks can receive the session viewer as their third argument. Announce viewer buckets there; background writers must explicitly publish those bucket keys after commit.
- Built-in admin queries declare their permission policies alongside their schemas and read scopes. Consumers keep supplying the existing session and permission middleware layers.
- Local Work Board and Fleet queries declare their existing loopback read access explicitly so their generated live subscriptions remain available.
