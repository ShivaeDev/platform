### Breaking

- Identity treats an undeclared stored user role as a defect naming the role, rather than `AuthUnavailable`. RPC request tracing logs the defect and Better Auth's session endpoint returns HTTP 500. Consumers must correct the user's stored role or restore its application declaration; reserve `AuthUnavailable` handling for provider outages.

- Admin role assignment trusts its typed role input and leaves session role resolution to identity. RPC consumers need no change: the contract decodes the role. Direct callers of `changeUserRole` must decode untrusted role input with the application's `Role` schema before calling it.
