### Added

- Session hosts bound to a non-loopback address without proxy trust warn at startup to configure `TRUSTED_PROXY` or `config.trustedProxy` before forwarding RPC requests.

### Fixed

- Development auth accepts both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` over HTTP on any port when `PUBLIC_URL` is unset. Explicit `baseURL` and `trustedOrigins` options replace those defaults.
- Auth rate limiting uses the connection peer address without a trusted proxy, separating client buckets and avoiding Better Auth's missing-client-IP warning. Trusted forwarding still takes precedence, and untrusted forwarding headers are ignored.
