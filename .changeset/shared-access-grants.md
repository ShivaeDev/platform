### Breaking

- Access, identity and React now share access's grant evaluator: an `any` grant covers an `own` check for the same permission name. An `own` grant still cannot cover an `any` check. Applications that need separate capabilities must declare separate permission names; record ownership checks still belong in `canAccess` or `requireAccess`.
- Replace `Access.requirePermission(user, permission)` with `requirePermission(yield* Access.resolve(user.role), permission)` from `@shivaedev/access/requirePermission.ts`. The new function takes a signed-in user; reject an absent session with `unauthorized()` from `@shivaedev/access/refusal.ts` before resolving its role. `requireAccess` continues to handle signed-out users itself.
- Replace identity's `requirePermission(permission)` with access's `requirePermission(yield* SessionUser, permission)`. There is no identity re-export. Admin's built-in handlers use this shared enforcement.
- Access's `requireAccess` now uses the shared permission refusal message, `Permission required: <name> (<strength>)`, instead of `Access denied: <name>`. Consumers should branch on the `Forbidden` tag.

### Added

- Access exports the `Permission` Schema and derives its type from it. Role resolution and identity session decoding use that Schema.
- Access exports `forbidden(permission)` and `unauthorized()` from `refusal.ts` for consistent permission refusals.
