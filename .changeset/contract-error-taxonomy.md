### Added

- Provide the shared expected failure schemas and `rejectedField` in `@shivaedev/effect-contract/errors/`, so browser-safe contract consumers can use them without depending on Platform. Tags, schema fields and RPC encoding remain the same.

### Breaking

- Move all imports from `@shivaedev/platform/errors/taxonomy.ts` to `@shivaedev/effect-contract/errors/taxonomy.ts`, and from `@shivaedev/platform/errors/rejectedField.ts` to `@shivaedev/effect-contract/errors/rejectedField.ts`. The old modules are removed. Add a direct `@shivaedev/effect-contract` dependency if the consuming package does not already declare one. Admin, GitHub, Work Board and Work Fleet public failure types now refer to these shared classes.
- Generated apps use the new imports. The create-app updater applies the starter changes through its usual three-way patch; it does not rewrite imports in app-owned files. Replace both old import paths above in those files when upgrading existing apps.
