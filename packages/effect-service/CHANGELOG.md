# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Build package JavaScript, declarations and source maps with TypeScript 7.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- Breaking: no root entry and no module that re-exports another. `exports` maps one `"./*.ts"` pattern to every module (`src` under the `source` condition, `dist` otherwise), so you import the module that defines a name, and a bundler sees only the modules you use. Where each name now lives:
  - `@shivaedev/effect-service`: `@shivaedev/effect-service/define-service.ts` (`defineService`), `@shivaedev/effect-service/generic-method.ts` (`genericMethod`), `@shivaedev/effect-service/service-requirements.ts` (`ServiceRequirements`)

## 0.1.1 - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- Imports that leave their folder go through `#` aliases declared in the `imports` field of `package.json`: `#*.ts` resolves to `src` under the `source` condition and to `dist` otherwise, and `#test/*` names a test file. The published modules and declarations name the package's own files through these aliases.

- Validate packed consumers and executable bins through the shared workspace gate.

- Build with the `@shivaedev/quality` tsconfig presets, which target ESNext and allow only erasable TypeScript syntax.

- Type-check with TypeScript 7 only. TypeScript 6 still builds the package.

- Lint and format with the `@shivaedev/quality` Biome preset through `quality lint` at the repository root, which replaces the package's `check` script.

- Run tests through the `@shivaedev/quality` Vitest projects, which take a test's environment from its file name. Type tests are named `*.typecheck.test.ts`.

- Keep `package.json` in sort-package-json key order, checked by `quality lint`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Declare service dependencies once and bind them in scoped initialization and
  ordinary Effect methods.
- Preserve typed initialization failures, method failures, caller scopes, and
  explicitly marked generic methods.
