### Added

- `migrationUpgrade({ migrations, upTo, table })` applies an older migration prefix and then the latest migrations on PostgreSQL, returning live column names and exact PostgreSQL types. `assertModelColumns(columns, model, types)` checks those columns against the model's database fields and an explicit type map, failing with `ModelColumnMismatch` for missing, extra or wrongly typed columns.
