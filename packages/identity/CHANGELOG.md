# Changelog

## 0.3.2 - 2026-10-29

### Changed

- Release with updated workspace dependencies.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-10-29

### Changed

- Release with updated workspace dependencies.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-28

### Added

- Identity exports `sweepExpiredSessions`, an Effect over the application's SQL client that deletes expired Better Auth sessions and returns the number removed without mounting auth.
- The starter worker sweeps expired auth sessions daily at midnight UTC. New apps and apps using the starter updater receive the schedule.
- `authTestDatabase(pool).expireSessions(userId)` expires only the selected user's sessions; omit the user id to expire every session.

### Fixed

- Enforce declared query read policies at the hosted RPC handler boundary, including contracts without identity middleware, whose viewer is anonymous. Query RPC error schemas include `QueryReadDenied` so native clients receive typed refusals before handlers run.
- Keep collection methods and untyped schema internals from making data parameters appear to carry callable services. Direct service implementations, nested dependency fields and service arrays remain subject to `effect/service-parameters`.

### Breaking

- Call `authTestDatabase(pool).expireSessions()` instead of yielding the `expireSessions` property directly.
- Move key imports from `@shivaedev/contract/keys.ts` to `@shivaedev/changes/keys.ts`. Declare bucket fields with `collection(name, idSchema, fields)` and publish affected buckets alongside record keys.
- Replace collection policy maps, `mergeReadPolicies`, `ReadPolicy` and `ReadPolicyMemoWindow` with each query's `readPolicy(payload, viewer)`. Declare the same query's live scope with `reads(payload, viewer)`. Bound query atoms and subscriptions refuse missing policies with a declaration error; one-off query `run` calls remain available. Denied queries refuse the entire subscription. Server adapters replace `QueryReads` and `ChangesReads` with `QueryDefinition` and `ChangesQueries`. Custom middleware calls `authorizeReads(effect, request, viewer)` and declares `MissingReadPolicy` and `QueryReadDenied` errors.
- Custom subscription adapters yield `ChangesQueries.resolve(references)`, call `querySubscription(requests, viewer)` and pass the authorized result to `makeLiveServer.subscribe(subscription, context)`. Metadata values expose `QueryDefinition.definition` and `CommandInvalidation.invalidates` instead of bare definitions and callbacks. Yield the Effect returned by `queryKeys(queries, references)` when projecting keys for a custom stream. `resolveChanges` supplies the authorized subscription in hosted applications. Changed hints can carry query positions so bindings can rerun session-scoped reads without deriving session scopes in the browser.
- Remove `appHost`'s `readPolicy` option and module policy registration. Session and permission middleware apply query policies using the current session viewer. Handle the new typed policy errors in native clients, including `QueryReadDenied` on query RPCs without identity middleware; widen explicit query error annotations accordingly.
- Replace `sessionCommandChanges` with `commandChanges` for custom session middleware. Command invalidation callbacks can receive the session viewer as their third argument. Announce viewer buckets there; background writers must explicitly publish those bucket keys after commit.
- Built-in admin queries declare their permission policies alongside their schemas and read scopes. Consumers keep supplying the existing session and permission middleware layers.
- Local Work Board and Fleet queries declare their existing loopback read access explicitly so their generated live subscriptions remain available.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-27

### Added

- Session hosts bound to a non-loopback address without proxy trust warn at startup to configure `TRUSTED_PROXY` or `config.trustedProxy` before forwarding RPC requests.

### Fixed

- Development auth accepts both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` over HTTP on any port when `PUBLIC_URL` is unset. Explicit `baseURL` and `trustedOrigins` options replace those defaults.
- Auth rate limiting uses the connection peer address without a trusted proxy, separating client buckets and avoiding Better Auth's missing-client-IP warning. Trusted forwarding still takes precedence, and untrusted forwarding headers are ignored.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-27

### Added

- First release of `@shivaedev/identity`: request identity and the RPC middleware declarations (`identity.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `permission.ts`), session resolution, Origin policy, trusted proxies, permission enforcement and request tracing (`server/`), and the Better Auth mount, sign-in policy and test helpers (`server/better-auth/`). The service and middleware ids now name the package (`@shivaedev/identity/Identity`, `@shivaedev/identity/Authenticated` and so on).
